     * Adds new recipients to a campaign. Each campaign can hold up to 5,000 recipients.

     * If you pass along a full name for your recipients, Mailshake will automatically
     * prepare first, last, and name (full name) as text replacements. If you only
     * have a first name, use that value as their full name.
     *
     * Any other fields you provide (like favorite_color) can be used as text replacements
     * within your campaign. If a text replacement isn’t found, that recipient’s emails
     * will not be scheduled until you make corrections.
     *
     * @param int         $campaignID          The campaign to add these recipients to.
     * @param bool        $addAsNewList        Pass true to keep these recipients grouped together.
     * @param bool        $truncateExtraFields Mailshake limits you to 30 recipient fields. If true then truncate.
     * @param string|null $listOfEmails        A comma or newline separated list of email addresses to add.
     * @param array|null  $addresses           A structured list of recipient data that can include custom fields.
